=
Easy CSS manipulation and Animations in Dart.

[Demo]

Notes  
-
  - This project is -for now- only a prototype, not a lib 
  - There is no documentation (only the code)
  - The Uses in the demo may differ in the actual code (only for the better)
  - The CSS part was inspired by jQuery and the Animation/Timeline is heavily based on BBC Glow
